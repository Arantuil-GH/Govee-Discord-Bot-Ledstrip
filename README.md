This file should contain the follow constants:
- DISCORDBOTTOKEN = 'your_discord_bot_token'
- API_KEY = 'your_govee_api_key'
- DEVICEMAC = 'your_govee_device_macaddress'
- DEVICEMODEL = 'your_devicemodel'

## To-do list:
- Rate limit on the bot side (not on the side of the discord channel, which server owners could bypass).
